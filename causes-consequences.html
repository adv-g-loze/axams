            <h2>Causes and Consequences of Cyberbullying</h2>
            <p>Cyberbullying is often driven by factors such as anonymity, peer pressure, and the ease of spreading harmful content. The consequences can be severe, leading to emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and in extreme cases, even suicidal thoughts.</p>
             <h3>Causes of Cyberbullying </h3>
             <p>
Anonymity: The perceived anonymity of online platforms emboldens bullies, who feel they can evade repercussions.

Peer Pressure: Students may engage in cyberbullying to fit in with a certain group or to avoid becoming targets themselves.

Power Dynamics: Some students use cyberbullying as a way to exert power and control over others.

Lack of Supervision: Inadequate monitoring of online activities by parents and schools can lead to an increase in cyberbullying incidents.

Easy Access: The widespread availability of smartphones and internet access makes it easier for students to engage in cyberbullying at any time.</p>
            <h4>Consequences of Cyberbullying </h4>
            <p>
Emotional Distress: Victims often experience anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.

Academic Problems: Cyberbullying can lead to decreased academic performance and absenteeism as victims avoid school to escape harassment.

Physical Health Issues: The stress of being cyberbullied can cause physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, and sleep disturbances.

Social Isolation: Victims may withdraw from friends and social activities, feeling isolated and alone.

Suicidal Thoughts: In severe cases, cyberbullying has been linked to suicidal ideation and even attempts.</p>
