            <h2>What is Cyberbullying?</h2>
            <p>Cyberbullying involves the use of digital technology to harass, threaten, or humiliate someone. This can happen through social media, text messages, emails, or any other online platform. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying can happen anytime and can spread quickly to a wide audience. Its impact can be severe, affecting victims' mental health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. It's crucial to address and prevent it, to ensure a safe and respectful online environment.</p>
            <h3>EXAMPLE OF CYBERBULLYING IN SCHOOL</h3>
            <h4 class="case-title">Case Study: The Anonymous Messages</h4>
            <p>A student named Johhan Nhinda began receiving anonymous messages on social media. These messages were cruel and targeted Johhan's appearance and abilities, making them feel isolated and worthless. The messages were sent at all hours, causing Johhan to lose sleep and perform poorly in school. Despite blocking the accounts, new ones kept appearing, making it seem like there was no escape.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Johhan confided in a trusted teacher who alerted the school's administration. The school worked with the social media platform to identify the bully, who turned out to be a fellow student. The bully faced disciplinary action, and the school provided support to Johhan, including counseling sessions to help rebuild confidence and mental well-being.</p>
            <p>This example highlights the persistent and invasive nature of cyberbullying and the importance of a supportive school environment in addressing such incidents.</p>
